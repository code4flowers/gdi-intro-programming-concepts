				<h2>How Computers Think</h2>
				<p>
					Computers have three types of memory &mdash; <strong class="blue">Read-Only Memory</strong>,
					<strong class="blue">Hard Drive Memory</strong>, and <strong class="blue">Random Access Memory</strong>.
				</p>

				<aside class="notes">
					... once digital computers arrived, the base on which computers did all of their thinking, colloquially referred to as “memory,” stabilized into three forms, . It operates a little differently from human memory, but I'll try to make it as clear as possible.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<!-- How Do Computers Do Their Thinking: ROM -->
				<h2>How Computers Think: ROM</h2>
				<p>
					<strong class="blue">ROM</strong>, or <strong class="blue">Read-Only Memory</strong>, is hardwritten into chips and handles data essential to a computer's operation.
				</p>

				<aside class="notes">
					ROM, or read-only memory, is memory that’s hardwritten onto chips. This kind of memory is typically responsible for serving up the kind of data that’s your computer would be hard-pressed to operate without — like an operating system. Of course, making
					it quick to access means that files in it can’t be edited, and means that your computer won’t forget how to operate when it’s turned off. Do we have any gamers in our midst? Or been down to 16-Bit?
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>How Computers Think: ROM</h2>
				<small>Cartridge-based video games are a small example of read-only memory.</small>
				<img src="images/slide-images/rom-cartridge.png" alt="A dissected Game Boy game cartridge.">

				<aside class="notes">
					In the arcade and early home gaming eras, games were printed as read-only memory onto chips and read directly and immediately by their computer systems. One of the pitfalls of writing data to ROM is that space is limited to what you can physically place
					on the chips, which is why you don't see many cartridges in use nowadays.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>How Computers Think: ROM</h2>
				<img src="images/slide-images/supermarioworld.gif" alt="A screenshot of Super Mario World.">

				<aside class="notes">
					It did, however, make these games run at a very snappy pace, which is why we may have had to suffer through replaying levels in older games, it wasn't paired with the indignity of having to sit through a loading screen like we do with games on discs.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>How Computers Think: ROM</h2>
				<small><strong class="blue">Read-Only Memory</strong> functions similarly to the brainstem.</small>
				<img src="images/slide-images/heavy-breathing-cat.gif" alt="A fat cat with the caption 'heavy breathing' breathes heavily.">

			</section>

			<aside class="notes">
				In a computer, it operates a bit like your brain stem — taking care of activities that are necessary to life so you don’t have to spend all of your thinking on performing them, like breathing. I am sorry if you are now thinking about breathing and actively
				doing it right now.
			</aside>

			<!-- How Do Computers Do Their Thinking: Hard Drive Memory -->

			<section>
				<h2>How Computers Think: <br>Hard Drive Memory</h2>
				<p>
					<strong class="blue">Hard Drive Memory</strong> is editable memory that holds files and programs that you create and install.
				</p>

				<aside class="notes">
					Hard drive memory — not explicitly named as memory, but still, technically memory, holds files and programs on your computer that you create and install. While ROM is fixed, memory on your hard drive can be written and edited, which makes it very much
					like long-term memory. When you “save” files, you’re writing them to your hard drive. Flash drives, similarly, are a type of hard drive memory.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>How Computers Think: <br>Hard Drive Memory</h2>
				<img src="images/slide-images/insideout.jpeg" alt="The Emotions from Inside Out">

				<aside class="notes">
					The human analogue of this type of computer memory is long-term memory. If you’ve seen the movie Inside Out, the way in which memories are stored is actually pretty similar to how computers hold onto data.
				</aside>

			<!-- How Do Computers Do Their Thinking: RAM -->

			<section>
				<h2>How Computers Think: RAM</h2>
				<p>
					<strong class="blue">RAM</strong>, or <strong class="blue">Random Access Memory</strong> is volatile memory that handles data that the computer is actively using.
				</p>

				<aside class="notes">
					... is volatile — the data it grapples with isn’t ‘written’ anywhere, just temporarily stored on a series of electrified capacitors. The more capacitors there are dedicated to this purpose, the more a computer can do at once. Has anyone had their computer
					crash and lost hours worth of work before?

			<section data-background="images/slide-images/dawsoncrying.gif">
				<!-- A picture of a cartoon dog in a burning house staying put and
							saying "This is fine." -->
				<aside class="notes">
					This is RAM's fault. Yes, dear friends — this is why there’s a whole lot of weeping and your recent work to files is lost to the ether in the case of a computer crash — your RAM doesn’t suddenly loses context and you’re left with a blank slate.
				</aside>

			<section>
				<h2>How Computers Think: RAM</h2>
				<img src="images/slide-images/50firstdates.jpg" alt="Confused Drew Barrymore sitting next to Adam Sandler.">

				<aside class="notes">
					Computers are very much like Drew Barrymore's character in 50 First Dates — doomed to lose any "new" memories whenever she loses consciousness. Both tragic, and a blessing in that, as far as she knows, Adam Sandler's filmography ends in the year 2003.
					Fortunately, a lot of programs do some stealth-saving in the background and provide you with recovery files, but that pain and terror is a part of RAM.
				</aside>

				<h2>How Computers Think: RAM</h2>
				<p>
					<strong class="blue">RAM</strong> is like our working memory.
				</p>
				<img class="fragment" src="images/slide-images/jenny.gif" style="height: 40vh" alt="Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope looking disgusted with herself.">

				<aside class="notes">
					In this way, RAM is quite a bit like working memory. If you meet someone and exchange telephone numbers, it’s likely that you’ll forget those 7-10 digits when you’re provided with additional distraction unless you make a conscious choice to memorize that
					phone number. Meanwhile, Tommy Tutone has ensured that most people of a certain age remember Jenny’s phone number.

					Another side benefit of this course I forgot to mention is that a little bit of the mystery can be taken out of computer specs. Can anyone parse what the highlighted items indicate? There is a caveat, being that colloquially, “memory” refers to RAM. Nowadays,

				<aside class="notes">
					Assembly code… looks vaguely better than a sweep of binary. It was more user-friendly in this respect, but a big problem with assembly languages is that they’re incredibly specific — in that they only work on a single type of computer. Which sounds like

				</p>
				<aside class="notes">
					Now, we start to get to the fun part, where we start talking to computers. However... there are some things to be aware of. While programming languages have gotten easier to read and write, what we ask the computer to do will ultimately be taken by the
					compiler and converted into a series of zeros and ones. It is said that the best thing about computers is that they will do exactly what you tell them to do. It’s also said that the worst thing about computers is that they do exactly what you tell
					them to do.

				<h2>Let's Talk To Computers: Concepts</h2>
				<h3>5 Concepts of every Language</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Tools *
					</li>
					<li>
						Syntax *
					</li>
					<li>
						Variables
					</li>
					<li>
						Control Structures
					</li>
					<li>
						Data Structures *
					</li>

				</ol>
				</br>

			</section>

			<section>
				<!-- Let's meet the console. -->
				<h2>Tools</h2>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">
						Terminal or command line
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						The IDE, Intergrated Development Environment
					</li>

					<li class="fragment">
						The developer community!
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Let's Meet the Terminal!</h3>
				<p>
					The <strong class="blue">terminal</strong> is a tool where we run chunks of code and test them to make sure that it's behaving in the way we want it to.
				</p>
				<p>
					For this course, we'll be making use of an online terminal named <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">repl.it</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://repl.it/classroom/invite/e7JIQC" target="_blank">GDI Dayton Intro To Programming Concepts Variables and If/Then/Else</a> <br />
				</p>

				<aside class="notes">
					But before we get started, let's meet the terminal! The terminal is a space where we can run chunks of code and test them to make sure that it's behaving predictably. Open up the variables assignment As I alluded to earlier, we'll be sampling from Ruby,
					Python, and JavaScript, but for this initial portion, we'll be using JavaScript, which Taylor is going to be running the Intro class for next Wednesday.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Syntax</h3>
				<p>

					The <b>Syntax</b> of a programming language is the set of rules that define the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in that language.

				</p>
				<aside class="notes">
					This is what makes each lanugae unique
				</aside>

			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Variables</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A variable is a storage container for information.</li>
					<li>Examples:</li>
					<pre><code>
age = 28
color = "blue"
					</code></pre>
					<li>There are different kinds of variables based on the information that you want to store.</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					Some of of you may remember variables from algebra — but if any of you have some post-traumatic stress from this time, fear not — there's no need to solve for anything, variables are our friends, and they help us store information that we can access later
					in our code. The computer will be manipulating all of your variables, you will just be telling it how. There are a few different types of information that can be stored as variables — some of which are numbers, strings, and booleans. The variables
					in the code chunk above are strings.
				</aside>

			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Number Variables</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Number or integer variables are used to store positive or negative whole numbers.</li>
				</ul>
				<pre><code>
age = 28
year = 2016
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>String Variables</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>String variables are used to store text.</li>
				</ul>
				<pre><code>
name = "K.C. Jones-Evans"
myString = 'Hello World'
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Numbers as strings</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You <b>can</b> store a number as a string variable.</li>
					<li>If you store a number as a string variable, you can’t use it in any math calculations.</li>
				</ul>
				<pre><code>
age = "28"
year = '2016'
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Boolean Variables</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Boolean variables are used to store the value <b>TRUE</b> or <b>FALSE</b> (yes or no).</li>
				</ul>
				<pre><code>
am_i_a_cat = false
areMyEyesGreen = true
				</code></pre>
			</section>


			<section>
				<h3>Control Structures</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Now that you can store data, you probably want to do something with it.</li>

					<li>There are two groups of control structures:
						<ul>
							<li>If/Else statements</li>
							<li>Loops</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

				</ul>
			</section>



			<section>
				<h3>If/Then/Else</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If/Then/Else statements evaluate a condition and take actions based on the result.</li>
				</ul>
				<pre class="fragment">
						<code>
if MY_CONDITIONS then DO_ALL_THE_THINGS
else DO_SOMETHING_ELSE_ENTIRELY end
						</code>
					</pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Boolean Operators on Variables</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Boolean Operators are words or symbols that let you compare, combine, or evaulate input or varaibles to produce an output.</li>

					<li>A few examples:
						<table class="box copy--small">
							<tr>
								<td width="200"><code>a == b</code></td>
								<td>a is equal to b</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>a != b</code></td>
								<td>a does not equal b</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>a &lt; b</code></td>
								<td>a is less than b</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>a &gt; b</code></td>
								<td>a is greater than b</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>a &lt;= b</code></td>
								<td>a is less than or equal to b</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>a &gt;= b</code></td>
								<td>a is greater than or equal to b</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>a and b</code></td>
								<td>a and b together!</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>a or b</code></td>
								<td>a or b</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
				</ul>

				<h3>Beware the Infinite Loop!</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>An infinite loop is a loop that will never meet the condition to stop. It will keep going until it's used up all your computer's (or server's) memory (RAM). This is bad!</li>
					<li>Example: In the While loop:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If the "papers_to_deliver = papers_to_deliver - 1" line was missing, it would keep looping because 65 is always greater than 0!</li>
						<li>If "papers_to_deliver = papers_to_deliver - 1" was changed to "+ 1", it would keep adding 1 to 65 forever!</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</section>


			<section>
				<h3>Data Structures</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						Having data structures provides two key things:
						<ol>
							<li>
								Keeps us from repeating code
							</li>
							<li>
								Allows us to keep the code flexible
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						In essence, a data structure is just a way to get around having to create tons of variables.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Data Structures Exercise </h3>
				<ul>
					<li>For this excercise, we're using Java.</li>
					<li>Go to <a href="https://repl.it/classroom/invite/e9PF0I" target="_blank">GDI Dayton Intro To Programming Concepts Data Structures</a> </li>

				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Data Structures Exercise (1/2)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li class="">If we need to store 10 contacts, we would probably define 10 variables, right?
						<pre>
						<code>
String contact1, contact2, contact3, contact4, contact5, contact6, contact7, contact8, contact9, contact10;
contact1 = "John Smith (john.smith@someCompany.com)";
contact2 = "Jane Smith (jane.smith@someCompany.com)";
contact3 = //... etc.
						</code>
					</pre>
					</li>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3 class="">Data Structures Exercise (2/2)</h3>
				<li class="">
					Instead we are going to use Java's data structure ArrayList
					<pre>
							<code>
List contacts = new ArrayList();

contacts.add("John Smith (john.smith@someCompany.com)");
contacts.add("Jane Smith (jane.smith@someCompany.com)");
							</code>
						</pre>
				</li>

				<h3>Data Structures Continued</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Every language has it's own set of data structures, and their own unique way of organizing data.
					</li>
					<li>
						There are so many types, that we can't cover them all!
